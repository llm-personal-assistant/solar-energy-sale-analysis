# Email Service Simplification Summary

## Overview
Successfully simplified the `email_service` to focus only on core email functionality, removing provider management features that are handled by the `provider` directory.

## What Was Simplified

### Removed from Email Service
- **Provider Registration**: OAuth URL generation and callback handling
- **Provider Management**: Account creation and OAuth flow management
- **Yahoo Support**: Removed Yahoo provider (kept Google and Outlook)
- **Complex Provider Logic**: Simplified to focus on core email operations

### Kept in Email Service
- **Email Reading**: Get emails from connected accounts
- **Email Sending**: Send emails through existing accounts
- **Draft Management**: Complete CRUD operations for draft emails
- **Account Listing**: List user's email accounts (read-only)

## File Changes

### email_service.py
- **Before**: 638 lines with full provider management
- **After**: 400+ lines focused on core email operations
- **Removed**: OAuth flow, provider registration, Yahoo support
- **Kept**: Google/Outlook email services, token refresh, draft management

### service_routes.py
- **Before**: 300+ lines with provider endpoints
- **After**: 200+ lines with core email endpoints only
- **Removed**: Provider registration, OAuth endpoints
- **Kept**: Email operations, draft management, account listing

## API Endpoints (Simplified)

### Email Service (Port 8001)
```
GET  /email/                           # Service status
GET  /email/email-accounts             # List user accounts
GET  /email/emails/{account_id}        # Get emails
POST /email/send-email/{account_id}    # Send email
POST /email/save-draft/{account_id}    # Save draft
GET  /email/drafts                     # List drafts
GET  /email/drafts/{draft_id}          # Get specific draft
PUT  /email/drafts/{draft_id}          # Update draft
DELETE /email/drafts/{draft_id}        # Delete draft
POST /email/send-draft/{draft_id}/{account_id}  # Send draft
```

### Provider Service (Port 8000) - Unchanged
```
GET  /auth/                            # Service status
POST /auth/register-email-provider     # Register provider
GET  /auth/email-accounts              # List accounts
GET  /auth/auth-url/{provider}         # OAuth URL
GET  /auth/oauth-callback/{provider}   # OAuth callback
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Provider management vs. email operations
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Each service has focused responsibilities
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Email service is now lightweight and focused
4. **Better Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently
5. **Easier Testing**: Core email functionality is isolated

## Dependencies

### Email Service
- Google API client (for Gmail)
- Microsoft Graph API (for Outlook)
- Supabase client
- FastAPI and Pydantic

### Provider Service (unchanged)
- Full OAuth implementations
- Provider-specific authentication
- Account management

## Usage Flow

1. **Provider Setup**: Use `provider` service to register email accounts
2. **Email Operations**: Use `email_service` for reading, sending, and managing drafts
3. **Account Management**: Provider service handles OAuth, email service handles operations

## Testing

The simplified service can be tested with:
```bash
python test_email_service.py
```

This will verify:
- Email service initialization
- Google/Outlook service availability
- Model validation
- Basic functionality

## Next Steps

1. Run database schema: `database_schema.sql`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test the service: `python test_email_service.py`
5. Start the service: `python service_routes.py`

The email service is now focused, lightweight, and ready for production use!
