# Email Service Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a new `email_service` directory with core email functionality. The service focuses on essential email operations: reading emails, sending emails, and managing draft emails. Provider management functionality remains in the `provider` directory.

## What Was Created

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Email Sending (`POST /email/send-email/{account_id}`)
- Send emails through multiple providers (Google, Outlook, Yahoo)
- Support for HTML and plain text emails
- Automatic token refresh for expired credentials

#### 2. Email Reading (`GET /email/emails/{account_id}`)
- Retrieve emails from connected accounts
- Configurable limit for number of emails
- Proper email parsing and formatting

#### 3. Draft Email Management
- **Save Draft**: `POST /email/save-draft/{account_id}`
- **Get All Drafts**: `GET /email/drafts`
- **Get Specific Draft**: `GET /email/drafts/{draft_id}`
- **Update Draft**: `PUT /email/drafts/{draft_id}`
- **Delete Draft**: `DELETE /email/drafts/{draft_id}`
- **Send Draft**: `POST /email/send-draft/{draft_id}/{account_id}`

#### 4. Email Account Management
- List user email accounts (provider registration handled by provider service)

### Database Schema
- Created `draft_emails` table with proper indexing and RLS policies
- Added `status` column to `email_messages` table
- Implemented automatic timestamp updates for drafts

### Models
- Enhanced Pydantic models with proper validation
- Added `EmailStatus` enum for better type safety
- Comprehensive request/response models

## What Was Removed from Provider

### Removed from `provider/provider_routes.py`:
- `get_emails()` endpoint
- `send_email()` endpoint
- `SendEmailRequest` model
- `EmailMessageResponse` model
- `EmailMessage` import (no longer needed)

### Preserved in Provider:
- Email account registration
- OAuth authentication flow
- Provider management functionality

## API Endpoints Summary

### Email Service (Port 8001)
```
GET  /email/                           # Service status
GET  /email/email-accounts             # List accounts
GET  /email/emails/{account_id}        # Get emails
POST /email/send-email/{account_id}    # Send email
POST /email/save-draft/{account_id}    # Save draft
GET  /email/drafts                     # List drafts
GET  /email/drafts/{draft_id}          # Get draft
PUT  /email/drafts/{draft_id}          # Update draft
DELETE /email/drafts/{draft_id}        # Delete draft
POST /email/send-draft/{draft_id}/{account_id}  # Send draft
```

### Provider Service (Port 8000)
```
GET  /auth/                            # Service status
POST /auth/register-email-provider     # Register provider
GET  /auth/email-accounts              # List accounts
GET  /auth/auth-url/{provider}         # OAuth URL
GET  /auth/oauth-callback/{provider}   # OAuth callback
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Core email functionality is isolated from provider management
2. **Enhanced Features**: Added comprehensive draft management
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between provider management and email operations
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Email service focuses only on essential email operations
5. **Scalability**: Each service can be deployed and scaled independently
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend email-specific features

## Next Steps

1. Run the database schema migration: `database_schema.sql`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test the service: `python test_email_service.py`
5. Start the service: `python service_routes.py`

## Testing

The service includes a test script (`test_email_service.py`) that verifies:
- Email manager initialization
- Provider availability
- Model validation
- Basic functionality

Run with: `python test_email_service.py`
